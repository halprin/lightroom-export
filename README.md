# lightroom-export
Export your Adobe Lightroom Catalog to Apple Photos

# Why?

Because Adobe reneged on their word to keep a perpetual licensing model for
Lightroom.  I will not support that.

# Details

This is a crapily written piece of software.  It's in one file, a bunch of commented out code, and next to no
documentation!  Perhaps you will find some good tidbits here in there to help you understand Lightroom and Photos
internals.
